# Errors and Debugging Roundtable Activity

## Activity Workflow

Work together with your group to identify and fix the bugs in this codebase.
1. Take time to observe how Python reports the error in the stack trace
2. Pay attention to
    * File names
    * Line numbers
    * Error type
3. Before fixing each error:
    * State what the error is
    * Hypothesize the cause of the error
    * Propose a fix
  
  *NOTE*: DO NOT edit any of the test_ functions
