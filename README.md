# Intro to Debugging Roundtable Activity

## Activity Workflow

Work together with your group in breakout rooms to identify and fix the bugs in this codebase.

### Choose one teammate to execute the following steps:
1. Fork and clone this repo
2. Set up the project
    * After cloning the project, change into the project directory: `cd errors-and-debugging`
    * Create your virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
    * Activate your virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`

### After the project has been set up, work together to identify and fix the bugs.
1. From the root of the project directory, execute this terminal in this command: `python main.py` 
2. Observe how Python reports the error in the stack trace. Make sure to work through the issues __together__ using VS Codeâ€™s LiveShare or Zoom screen sharing!
3. Pay attention to
    * File names
    * Line numbers
    * Error type
4. Before fixing each error:
    * State what the error is
    * Hypothesize the cause of the error
    * Propose a fix
  
  *NOTE*: DO NOT edit any of the `test_` functions

### If you finish early, use this time to discuss your strategies for debugging together!
* Potential discussion questions: 
   * What have you tried in the past? 
   * What worked well for you? 
   * What strategies do you want more practice in? 
   * How do you plan to incorporate them?
